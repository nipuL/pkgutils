5.20		- Released 2005-05-04
		- pkgadd/rejmerge will now consider user, group and access
		  permissions on rejected files.

5.19		- Released 2005-03-29
		- pkgadd: improved support for automatically removing
		  rejected files that are identical to already installed files.
		- pkgmk: added support for resuming interrupted downloads.
		  Thanks to Johannes Winkelmann <jw@tks6.net>
		- pkgmk: added option -cm/--check-md5sum, which checks the
		  md5sum but does not build the package.
		- libtar: fixed bug in symlink handling.
		  Thanks to Guillaume Bibaut <guillaume.bibaut@free.fr>

5.18		- Released 2004-05-16
		- rejmerge: files created when merging will now get the same
		  access permissions as the installed version.
		  Thanks to Han Boetes <han@mijncomputer.nl>
		- rejmerge: file diffs/merges are now piped through more(1).
		- pkgadd/pkgrm: fixed a bug that could result in a corrupt 
		  database when running low on disk space.
		- pkgadd: directories can now be specified in rules in
		  pkgadd.conf. (This fix was supposed to be part of the 5.14
		  release, but was forgotten and actually never included).

5.17		- Released 2004-05-10
		- Fixed two bugs in rejmerge.

5.16		- Released 2004-05-09
		- pkgmk no longer redirects errors to /dev/null when removing
		  the work dir.
		- Minor man page updates.

5.15		- Released 2004-05-02
		- Fixed bug in makefile.

5.14		- Released 2004-05-02
		- Added new utility called rejmerge.
		  See rejmerge(8) man page for more information.
		- pkginfo -o now accepts regular expressions.
		- Directories can now be specified in rules in pkgadd.conf.
		- pkgadd/pkgrm now executes ldconfig after installing/removing
                  a package.
		- Minor cleanups.

5.13		- Released 2003-12-16
		- Removed "link to ..." from .footprint.
		- pkgmk now allows the source=() array to be empty. This
		  is useful for packages that only want create directory
		  structures and/or symlinks.

5.12		- Released 2003-11-30
		- Added support for .nostrip, an optional file containing
		  regular expressions matching files that should not be
		  stripped. Thanks to Dave Hatton <mail@davehatton.it>

5.11		- Released 2003-11-27
		- Fixed bug in footprint generation.
		- Fixed bug in file stripping.

5.10		- Released 2003-11-08
		- pkginfo: Added option -f/--footprint, which generates a
		  package footprint. The old method for generating footprints
		  failed in special cases.
		- pkgmk: Updated to use pkginfo -f when creating footprints.
		- pkgmk: Fixed bug in man page compression.
		- pkgmk: Removed support for ROOT in Pkgfiles, use PKGMK_ROOT
		  instead.
		- pkgmk: Removed support for SOURCE_DIR, PACKAGE_DIR and
		  WORK_DIR, use PKGMK_SOURCE_DIR, PKGMK_PACKAGE_DIR and
		  PKGMK_WORK_DIR instead.

5.9		- Released 2003-10-19
		- Fixed bug in database backup code.
		- Rejected files that are empty or equal to the already
		  installed version are now automatically removed.

5.8		- Released 2003-10-03
		- Fixed memory leak in pkgadd.
		- Patched libtar to fix memory leak.
		- Patched libtar to reduce memory usage.
		- Updated default pkgadd.conf.

5.7		- Released 2003-07-31
		- pkgmk: Reintroduced the $ROOT variable.

5.6		- Released 2003-07-05
		- pkgmk: Added automatic stripping of libraries (can be
		  disabled with -ns/--no-strip).
		- pkgmk: Added option -if/--ignore-footprint, which builds a
		  package without checking the footprint.
		- pkgmk: Synchronized names of variables exposed in pkgmk.conf
		  to avoid potential conflicts. All variables now start with
		  PKGMK_. The old names (SOURCE_DIR, PACKAGE_DIR and WORK_DIR)
		  still work but this backwards compatibility will be removed
		  in the future.

5.5		- Released 2003-05-03
		- pkgmk: Added support for alternative source, package and work
		  directories. Variables SOURCE_DIR, PACKAGE_DIR and WORK_DIR
		  can be set in /etc/pkgmk.conf.
		  Thanks to Markus Ackermann <maol@symlink.ch>.
		- Minor changes to some info/error messages.

5.4		- Released 2003-03-09
		- pkgmk: Added option -c/--clean, which removes the package
		  and the downloaded source files.
		- Upgraded bundled libtar from 1.2.10 to 1.2.11. This
		  version of libtar fixes a spurious "permission denied"
		  error, which sometimes occurred when running "pkgadd -u".

5.3		- Released 2003-02-05
		- pkgadd: the combination of -f and -u now respects the
		  upgrade configuration in /etc/pkgadd.conf. This is
		  needed to better support upgrades where ownership of
		  files has been moved from one package to another.
		- pkgadd/pkgrm/pkginfo: improved/reworked database locking
		  and error handling.
		- pkgmk: added -o to unzip to make it behave more like tar
		  and avoid user intaraction when overwriting files.
		  Thanks to Andreas Sundström <sunkan@zappa.cx>.
		- Upgraded bundled libtar from 1.2.9 to 1.2.10.

5.2		- Released 2002-12-08
		- pkgmk: exports LC_ALL=POSIX to force utilities to use a
		  neutral locate.
		- Upgraded bundled libtar from 1.2.8 to 1.2.9.

5.1		- Released 2002-10-27
		- Upgraded bundled libtar from 1.2.5 to 1.2.8.
		- pkgadd/pkgrm/pkginfo: Added file-locking on database to
		  prevent more than one instance of pkgadd/pkgrm/pkginfo from
		  running at the same time.
		- pkgadd: Fixed a bug in libtar that caused segmentation fault
		  when extracting files whose filenames contains characters
		  with ascii value > 127.
		- pkgmk: Fixed bug which caused suid/sgid binaries to become
		  unstripped.
		- pkgmk: Added option -ns/--no-strip. Use it to avoid stripping
		  binaries in a package.
		- pkginfo: -o/--owner does not require the whole path to the
		  file anymore.

5.0		- Released 2002-09-09
		- Now requires GCC 3.2 to compile (due to STL incompatibility).
		- pkginfo: -o/--owner now prepends the current directory to
		  the file argument unless it starts with /. This feature is
		  disable when using the -r/--root option.
		- pkgmk: The build() function will now be aborted as soon
		  as some command exits with an exit code other than 0 (zero).
		- pkgmk: Binaries are now stripped automatically.
		- pkgmk: Man pages are now compressed automatically.
		- pkgmk: Symlinks are always given access permissions
		  lrwxrwxrwx in .footprint, regardless of the actual
		  access permissions. This avoids footprint problems
		  when using e.g. XFS.

4.4		- Released 2002-06-30
		- Added option -cf, --config-file to pkgmk.
		- Minor bugfixes.

4.3		- Released 2002-06-11
		- Removed Pkgfile.local-feature which was added in 4.2. It
		  didn't work very well in some (common) situations.
		- Corrected spelling errors in pkgmk.

4.2		- Released 2002-05-17
		- Added support for Pkgfile.local, which enables users to
		  tweak packages by overriding parts of the original
		  Pkgfile. This is useful when pkgmk is used in CRUX's
		  ports system, where users will loose changes made to the
		  original Pkgfile the next time they update their ports
		  structure.
		- Minor cleanups.

4.1		- Released 2002-04-08
		- Added support for preventing selected files (typically
		  configuration files) from being overwritten when upgrading
		  a package. The file /etc/pkgadd.conf, contains a list of
		  rules with regular expressions specifying these files. These
		  rules will be consulted when executing pkgadd with the
		  option -u. Files that, according to the rules, shouldn't be
		  upgraded will instead be installed under
		  /var/lib/pkg/rejected/. The user can then examine, use and
		  remove these files manually if so desired.
		- Added md5sum checking (.md5sum contains the MD5 checksum of
		  all source files). pkgmk uses this file to verify that
		  the (potentially downloaded) source files are correct.
		- Upgraded bundled libtar from 1.2.4 to 1.2.5.

4.0.1		- Released 2002-01-20
		- Removed warning "unable to remove XXX: Directory not empty"
		  when upgrading a package.

4.0		- Released 2002-01-14
		- Packages are now identified by their names only (and
		  not by name and version as before). This makes it easier
		  for users to upgrade and remove packages. This, of course,
		  comes with a price. You can not install two packages with
		  the same name.
		- The naming convention for packages is now:
			name#version-release.pkg.tar.gz
		  The character '#' is not allowed in package names, since
		  it's used as the name/version delimiter.
		- New database layout, which gives a more robust database
		  with a transaction-like behaviour. This implementation
		  will gurantee that the database will never be corrupted
		  even if the power fails when pkgadd/pkgrm is running. It
		  does however not guarantee that the database contents is
		  in sync with the filesystem if such a crash should occur.
		  This means that the database will _never_ loose track of
		  files that are installed, but it can (in case of a crash)
		  contain files that are actually not installed. Repeating
		  the pkgadd/pkgrm command that was running when the crash
		  occured will get the database in sync with the filesystem
		  again.
		- pkgmk is now capable of downloading missing source files
		  (using wget) before building a package (option -d), given
		  that the URL is specified in the "source" variable.
		- pkg.build was renamed to Pkgfile (to mimic make/Makefile).
		- pkg.contents was renamed to .footprint.
		- pkgmk is now capable of installing/upgrading a package if
		  the build was successful (option -i and -u).
		- Lot's of minor fixes and cleanups.

0.1 - 3.2.0	- Released 2000-05-10 - 2001-10-03
		(No change log was maintained during this time)
